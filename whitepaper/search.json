The foundation of this evolution is the connection through a proactive virtual assistant that connects you personally and emotionally with yourself and with others seeking to generate self-awareness and collective consciousness. Hands will change the way we live and work by providing extra value and generating a collaborative network that will help build a healthier community. How? Connect a user according to their skill, need, interest, geolocation and cost with another user with the skills and / or the means to meet their needs. Giving the user the possibility to donate their time or charge for it. • Get Hands that can be exchanged through the “Pay it forward scheme by other donated services conceived by the platform. • Receive the payment in crypto currency from the requester or receive “Hands coins” once the virtual bank is operating. The requesting user: If the providing user decides to get “Hands” instead of receiving the payment, the requesting user has the option to donate to the platform the exact amount that the provider is willing to receive in order to contribute to the pay it forward scheme. In order to participate in this pay it forward scheme, users must upload their skills (such as cooking, cleaning, designing, decorating, etc.) and donate their ","time to the platform so the community can validate that ability. Every time a new skill is upload, the user must validate it with another person for three free hours in order to corroborate if the user certainly possesses the expertise. Once this validation process begins, the user starts to build a reputation. Through time this reputation will increase depending on the different types of qualifications that the users receive based on the time, effort and dedication of his work. In order to make this functional, it is necessary to leave all these actions in the immutability. This immutability is generated through the blockchain, refer to the Bitcoin technology, where data is stored in a continuously-growing list of records called blocks. Each block contains a timestamp and a link to a previous block and the data in a block cannot be altered. This unable us to access and save the information concerning actions, ways and effects, or in other words, what people do, how do they do it and the effect that this has in others. By having this information, we can help and incite people to learn, grow and improve. Problem &amp; Opportunity On-demand-economy found niches where to expand and there are many successful companies that found lucrative models, but they all share the same problem: they are disjointed. An average person needs to navigate through a myriad of tools and options to find each solution: one app to get transportation, another one to schedule a haircut, another one to get a recipe, etc., and although many focused virtual assistants are emerging, they either want to sell products or help incorporate services. So the real question is: How can we put the focus and power in the user's Hands? How can we provide them the access to all knowledge in a actionable way? How can we help them success in their job or in their own businesses? How can we give them the ","chance to create new sources of income instead of trying to sell products and services to them? How can create a “pay-it-forward” community that generates value in a new way? How can we infuse their donated time, assets and goods in the best way possible? And last but not least, how can help people to improve and incite them to have healthier and happy relationships? Cause after all, nothing keeps us as healthy and happy as good human relationships. Solution An integrated multi-platform that dialogues with the user in order to help achieve his goals and help others achieve theirs. An application that connects with the needs of the user in a proactive, virtual and emotional way creating, thorught questions and answer, a matchmaking between people who have certain needs against people who have the skills or means to solve those needs. A personal assistant that have different emotions and expressions to subtly mark our mistakes and inconsistencies and shows us how we can improve those personal aspects that we want to improve and encourages us to do so. We pursuit to promote and encourage happy, healthy and dynamic interactions between us and at the same time to bring people together, to connect them in a new way and show them that good will, interaction and acknowledging other people’s abilities is all it takes to create a collaborative community that effectively fulfills everyone’s needs and desires. The fact is that high robotic tech is advancing by leaps and bounds and we are facing a close future with odds of having thousands of unemployed and marginalized people. We believe that in order to navigate this present and the upcoming future we must acknowledge each other’s needs and skills and we need to return to the ","beginning; we need to return to ourselves and start developing our self- awareness in order to conceive a collective awareness. Connection is the most valuable premise that we need to cultivate in order to generate a change and the way to create this connection is through empathy and collaboration; two abilities that we, humans, develop in order to evolve and be able to build wonderful things. Unfortunately, we have start to douse those abilities and we are getting to the point where it's getting harder to even teach the upcoming generation to acquire these abilities. The disconnection due to the lack of empathy and collaboration has leads us to be where we are today: in a disorganized community with huge communication and transparency issues. The point is that the more exponential the disconnection is, the more we forget what it means to share and cooperate and the further away from generating a positive change we will be. Hopefully, by recognizing our needs and learning how to serve others, we will re-build the trust that we need in order to change the way we relate with ourselves and with others. We believe that we have discover how to create such change with a simple Q&amp;A system. Cause after all, asking the right questions to the right person at the right moment can lead to the right answer and the right solution. ","Market Service providers, unemployed, wealthy individuals who want to help, professionals, high-income earners who want to automatize and solve problems. Competitors Chatbots Although we can integrate with many of them, our value proposal has a fluid match making between users.

Digital Asset Marketplace / Auctions Freely sell all, or part of your their own time and time of use of their objects in our decentralized marketplace to exercise the value stored in your skills and abilities assets. ","Assetization Economics &amp; The Notion of “Rareness” In order for us to understand the importance of “rareness” we must reinforce the notion of “Scarcity Value” in economics. This is defined as: Scarcity value is the economic factor that increases an item's relative price based more upon its relatively low supply. Whereas the prices of newly manufactured products depends mostly on the cost of production (the cost of inputs used to produce them, which in turn reflects the scarcity of the inputs), the prices of many goods—such as antiques, rare stamps, and those raw materials in high demand—reflects the scarcity of the products themselves. If we take this principal that is based around the scarcity of physical goods and applied it to digital currency you get – Bitcoin. If you take the same principle and enforce scarcity through notarization, enforcement, and monetization you get Hands. In order for a digital asset to realize its maximum value in a digital marketplace there has to be a notion of “rareness” or “scarcity”. With extensive plagiarism being rife online using RSS feed ‘syndication’ and simple copy/paste scarcity is something not respected in our current publishing paradigm. Google has taken an aggressive stance against this practice of duplicate or ‘copied content’ that isn’t considered unique or original. They deem that in these cases it does not hold any assessed ‘added value’ and as such is penalized in search rankings, getting lower views and lacking impact. In order to maximize the yield and return on digital assets published through Hands we couple our assetization platform with established copyright infringement API’s to create an enforced “rareness” and maximum value for content published through Hands. This is a very powerful concept and will revolutionize the way content is published and valued – maximizing impact, content views, and monetization as intrinsic benefits. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarcity_value ","Product Design Overview Hands creates a digital representation of the time value implemented by the user based on their skills, abilities, needs and objects in the Ethereum block chain by implementing an ERC20 standard smart token creation contract with a unique fingerprint. The content is notarized by the contract deployment and the ownership of the content is represented by the property of the namespace tokens. The token creation and ownership structure parameters are provided by the creator during the smart contract deployment. The files can be negotiated or maintained through a property model of the choice of the creator. Revenues are generated when the transaction is finalized and approved by the users the content is published through Hands and is scattered according to the configuration chosen by the owner. User Account &amp; Dashboard In order to encourage the adoption of cryptocurrency across a wider and more scalable mass audience, users must see and leverage the intrinsic value of cryptocurrency on a daily basis. Therefore, it is vitally important to integrate a blockchain based solution into a platform which will be rapidly adopted by end users and publishers in a frictionless and intuitive way. ","We see this as a massive opportunity for Hands to influence and educate its large potential user base with the benefits and economics of blockchain technology. Being an integral part of Hands’s assetization (rights management) and royalty back-end users will benefit from the technology without being technically savvy or needing to understand cryptocurrency. An easy to use dashboard and simple publishing flow will allow users seamless integration with blockchain technology. Smart Publishing Engine With our growing team of content producers, the logical approach to optimizing Hands’s value is to increase user influence on emerging environments at the individual level. To do this Hands employs a ‘Smart Publishing’ approach to revenue optimization which prioritizes relevance to trending needs, interests and skills on top search engines. Tailoring user to match trending environments increases search engine exposure, revenue generation and overall influence of the content producer. User is matched to currently trending skills, needs and/or skills via a proprietary environment modeling algorithm and suggestions that increase relevance to these environment are provided to the producer. Beyond that, Hands seizes opportunities to drive emerging trends, increasing the overall influence and value of the Hands platform. Trends are identifiable across streams of data using a cross dependence temporal environment model (CDTTM). A cross dependence temporal environment model identifies dependent and temporal correlation across streams of data for building correlated generative processes with mutual reinforcement. Read our Technical White Paper to understand more of the mathematics behind this process. ","Assetization &amp; Publishing Engine The crux of Hands’s value is our ability to ‘assetize’ or create a digital representation of content on the Ethereum blockchain. These representations are referred to as ’Namespace Tokens’, as their publicly accessible name attribute is composed of a logical grouping of unique identifiers. ERC20-standard ’Namespace Tokens’ are created via smart contract, each with an identifying payload that notarizes the user and its transaction. As we consider the shift towards ERC223 tokens, namespace tokens will also be compliant with this new protocol. Hands Royalty Disbursement Process The Namespace Tokens described above are the tool used to redeem royalties from the Hands platform. Royalties (at the owner’s choice) can be disbursed to token holders via a smart contract where the token(s) is used to attribute the correct allocation of royalties to its holder. This decentralized approach allows users to freely manage their assets without relying on the Hands platform if they so choose. Users also have the ability to automate the royalty distribution through our the Hands platform. This model provides a safer approach to royalty distribution than similar Dapps that rely on a third-party API (such as a block explorer for finding wallet addresses of token holders). Distribution occurs via a handshake where a token(s) is sent to a smart contract and revenue along with the token(s) is sent back to the token holder. Thus, if this wallet address is not ","hosted through our platform we can verify ownership and safely disburse revenue to the rightful owner. This decentralized approach allows users to freely manage their assets without relying on the Hands platform if they so choose. Furthermore, non-technical users have the ability to automate the royalty distribution by using Hands. Hands Revenue &amp; Royalty Model Flow ","Royalty Distribution Contract Architecture Created at the end of quarter - once revenue and royalties are known for all users. Monthly Active Contributors “MACs” The lifeblood of Hands’s platform are its monthly active users. These are users who are making 1-3 transactions of their needs, skills or interest to Hands every month. Each transaction will be valued by users, in this way users will have a score and will proactively seek to be better in their skills since they will have to compete with themselves.

Giving them the possibility to monetize their time and monetize the time of their own objects through notarization and monitoring in the Ethereum blockchain. When a user makes a transaction through Hands, they are paid royalties for the income generated by their time and registration of said transaction is protected by user rights through notarial certification in the Ethereum blockchain. Hands's engine goes further by optimizing the royalties through the increased influence of the user and the creation of the trend. Hands Platform The functionality of the Hands platform abstracts crowdsale analytics and interaction with the Ethereum blockchain with an intuitive user interface. Our approach is a mobile application that combines transaction management with the functionality of an ethereum portfolio. Royalties are generated from published transactions made and distributed to cardholders representing online transaction. Users can choose to have funds transferred as USD or as ETH via our royalty distribution model outlined below. Hands creates a digital representation of digital transactions on the Ethereum blockchain by deploying an ERC20- standard token-creating smart contract with a unique digital fingerprint. Transaction is notarized by the deployment of the con-tract and ownership of the transaction is represented by the ownership of these tokens. The parameters of token transaction and ownership structure are sup-plied by the user during ","deployment of the smart contract. Tokens can be traded or held via an ownership model of the users’s choosing. Royalties are generated when transaction is published through Hands. Hands empowers all transactions with the ability to notarize and monetize their time with the security and accessibility of a distributed ledger that blockchains provide. Hands Assetization The crux of Hands’s value is our ability to ”assetize” or create a digital rep- resentation of transaction on the Ethereum blockchain. These representations are referred to as ’Namespace Tokens’, as their publicly accessible name attribute is composed of a logical grouping of unique identifiers. ERC20-standard ’Namespace Tokens’ are created via smart contract, each with an identifying payload that notarizes the transaction and its users. Figure 1 schema describes information that will be available after decompression of a token’s digital fingerprint attribute. This JSON object corresponding to the schema above is compressed and added as a public attribute of the token creation contract as the pseudo-solidity code below ERC223 Compatibility We are monitoring the ERC223 token standard proposal1 and are factoring future compatibility of into the design of our Namespace tokens. https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/223 Hands Distribution The Namespace Tokens described above are the tool used to redeem royalties from the Hands platform. Royalties (at the owner’s choice) can be disbursed to token holders via a smart contract where the token(s) is used to attribute the correct allocation of royalties to its holder. This decentralized approach allows ","users to freely manage their assets without relying on the Hands platform if they so choose. Users also have the ability to automate the royalties distribution through our the Hands platform. This model provides a safer approach to royalty distribution than similar Dapps that rely on a third-party API (such as a block explorer for finding wallet addresses of token holders). Distribution occurs via a handshake where a token(s) is sent to a smart contract and royalties along with the token(s) is sent back to the token holder. Thus if this wallet address is not hosted through our platform we can verify ownership and safely disburse royalties to the rightful user. Rayality Distribution Contract Created per quarter – once royalities And payout are known for all users. Figure 1: Royalty Distribution Architecture Smart Publishing Transaction As the Hands platform grows, we are presented with a unique opportunity to optimize overall royalty generation by leveraging our scale. Below details our ","approach to scaling the Hands Platform and optimizing royalty generation with real-time machine learning. Hands employs a ”Smart Publishing Transaction” approach to royalty optimization which prioritizes relevance to trending interest, needs or/and skills of users on top search engines. Tailoring user to match trending interest, needs or/and skills of users increases search engine exposure, royalty generation and overall influence of the matches producer. User is matched to currently trending environment via a proprietary environment modeling algorithm and a suggestions that increase relevance to these environments are provided to the producer. Beyond that, Hands seizes opportunities to drive emerging trends, increasing the overall influence and value of the Hands platform. Trends are identifiable across streams of data using a cross dependence tem- poral environment model (CDTTM). A cross dependence temporal environment model iden-tifies dependent and temporal correlation across streams streams of data for building correlated generative processes with mutual reinforcement. Hands Smart Publishing Engine Hands Smart Publishing Engine recommends connects to users based upon trending environments identified in real-time. Using the methods described above, our engine performs real-time environment modeling between Hands and competing con-tent streams. From the user’s perspective we o ff er on demand edit suggestions to align sentiment to trending environments. An enviroment similarity score is generated by our matching algorithm between users skills, needs and interests, suggestions to in-crease enviroment relevance are then provided to the user. From a macro perspective, our engine provides suggestions to all Hands users when the potential to influ-ence the emergence of a trending topic presents itself. Using historical data and currently trending enviroments identified by our CDTTM platform, edit suggestions are provided in the same manner as our enviroment relevance score and users are rewarded for their contribution to resultant trends identified by the CDTTM platform after the trend creation campaign. ","Figure 2: User Transaction Architecture Conclusion The Hands Platform combined with our proactive artificial intelligence engine provides a next generation approach to monetizing the user's time and time of the user's own objects. Unlike other applications like Tinder, Facbook, Allo or My Study Life the match between people is much more accurate, operations are registered in the blockchain without the possibility of corrupting the history of their transactions. Hands goes beyond that by optimizing royalty generation, in fl uence and the ability to monetize or share value as the user chooses. These details will be abstracted by an intuitive user interface but will also be accessible to power users via public API. ",""]

Who are we? Hands bring a technological and social evolution. The foundation for this global revolution is the possibility to change the current economic system by integrating innovative technologies such as blockchain, ethereum, and lightning network to our day to day life in order to effectively combine daily human interactions with secure decentralized immutable transactions held by peer to peer payments around the globe. We are approximately 7.5 billion people in this world. 4 billion of us are economically active but still 3.5 billion people are operating outside the formal financial system. 205 million people are currently unemployed but projected to be around 3.4 million in two years due to rapid advance in technology and job automatization. The fact is, it doesn’t matter where we are positioned is in this percentages, neither what our current location is or if in a big or small scale we need to improve in some areas of our lives; everybody in this world wants or needs to give and receive a hand in different aspects of our personal, work, social and educational life. Some of us are willing to do this for free by donating our time, skills or objects and some of us are always expecting to receive some kind of economic retribution for the porpoise. No matter which position we want to take in this “battle”, it is clear that the needs and intentions are out there, but there is not yet an effective technology to connect them. Why not develop such technology? Why not develop it in a decentralized way where no formal financial system is needed? What if we can even operate with a cryptocurrency that can have an economic value for some aspects and a social value for some others? What is stopping us from creating a platform where people can genuinely express their needs, intentions, and expectations to the rest of the community in order to receive or give a hand for free or for a price? There is nothing that is stopping us for creating a community-driven network where people can upload their skills, share their interests and express their needs in order to get connected with others in the community that can be a perfect match to what they are looking for. ","5 The fact is, that thanks to the many improvements in the technological area in the last years, we are today blessed with the opportunity to develop useful and effective technologies to create a shared sense of positive coexistence. Being able to build a transparent system in the community brings the possibility to deliver our true needs and expectations and genuinely express our intentions. The blockchain technology allows us to create a decentralized ecosystem that contains one true information of everyone participating in the system. The information held on a blockchain exists as a shared and continually reconciled database. This is a way of using the network that has obvious benefits. The blockchain database isn’t stored in any single location; the records it keeps are truly public and easily verifiable. No centralized version of this information exists for a hacker to corrupt dismissing common problems like scamming, fraud or mistrust. Hosted by millions of computers simultaneously, its data is accessible to anyone, anywhere. Blockchain truly is a mechanism to bring everyone to the highest degree of accountability. No more missed transactions, human or machine errors, or even an exchange that was not done with the consent of the parties involved. Above anything else, the most critical area where blockchain helps us to guarantee the validity of a transaction by recording it not only on the main register but a connected distributed system of registers, all of which are connected through a secure validation mechanism. On the other hands, the etherum technology allows us to create our own cryptocurrency that differs from Bitcoin, as it contain a copy of both, the transaction list and the most recent state and at the same time to create smart contracts between people, simple immutable contracts that will execute when specified conditions are met. And last, but not least, the Lightning Network allows us to make instant payments. Lightning-fast blockchain payments without worrying about block confirmation times. Security is enforced by blockchain smart-contracts without creating an on blockchain transaction for individual payments. Payment speed measured in milliseconds to seconds and by transacting and settling off blockchain, the Lightning Network allows for exceptionally low fees, which allows for emerging use cases such as instant micropayments. ","6 All this comes to the conclusion that these technologies are in fact an incorruptible digital ledger of economic transactions that can be programmed to record not just financial transactions but virtually everything of value. So then, why not combine all these concepts together and start setting a non-economic value to our time and objects as well? We are the first borderless, shared economy and pay it a forward orientated platform that will give you the possibility to generate new sources of income outside the formal financial system and at the same time to generate a new way of trade-off pay it forward economy. Along with the creation of our own economic valued cryptocurrency called  HANDS  and dismissing the tendency of developing a reactive application, we have decided to take a step forward and design a community-driven social network hosted by a proactive virtual assistant that will give you the possibility to give or receive a hand in every aspect of your work, personal, social and educational life without any censorship, fraud or third-party interference. Hands virtual assistant has the ability to learn about your day to day life, your skills, and your interests in order to introduce you to people that may need your expertise, that shares your same passions or even invite you to different communities you can participate in. At the same time, this virtual assistant is designed to identify your personal and social needs as well as your work and educational aspirations in order to connect you with other people with the means, skills, availability or predisposition to help you. 1.2. How do we do this? It all starts with a simple question: What are you looking for today? By asking correctly segmented and geolocated questions along with simple preset data flows of Q&A in each environment (personal, work, social and education) we are able to create with each answer, better segmented and focused coincidences between users allowing them to experience more authentic and successful connections in every aspect of their lives. ","7 By setting a verification and rating system in the blockchain for each successful coincidence we are able to provide a secure platform that people can trust and where users can start to build a reputation. Every action will be stored in a block that will contain a timestamp and a link to a previous data that cannot be altered. By doing so, all the interactions and connections between users will be immutable, giving us the possibility to access and save the information concerning actions, ways, and effects, or in other words, what people do, how do they do it and the effect that these actions have in others. By having this information, we can help and incite people to learn, grow and improve. 1.3. How do Hands works? In order to be part of the community, users must upload their skills (such as cooking, cleaning, designing, decorating, programming, babysitting, etc.) and go through the secure verification process by uploading their personal identification card or passport and validated certifications if they are required to prove the existence of a certain expertise. Every time a new skill that doesn’t require a certification is upload, the user must validate it with another person for one hour in order to corroborate if the user certainly possesses the expertise. All this information will be processed and stored in the blockchain and cannot be altered. Once this validation process begins, the user starts to build a reputation. Through time this reputation will increase or decrease depending on the different types of qualifications that the user receives based on the time, effort and result of his/her work. Users can also upload their profiles their available time to help others in certain personal, work, social or educational causes by either choosing to donate their time or setting a maximum and minimum price. Objects and spaces are also available for uploading in the system. Users can once again decide if they want to donate their objects and spaces or if they want to set a certain price for each of them. ","8 1.4. How does the pay it forward and payment process works? The providing user: If the user decides to set a price for his/her time, skill, object or space they can receive the payment in “ HANDS ” (our economic value cryptocurrency) and keep the transaction list and the most recent state in their virtual wallet. If the user decides to donate his/her time, skill, object or space they will get Hands (our non-economic social value cryptocurrency) that later can be exchanged through the “Pay it forward scheme by other donated services or products conceived in the platform. The requesting user: If the providing user decides to get “Hands” instead of receiving the payment in “ HANDS ”, the requesting user has the option to donate to the platform the exact amount that the provider is willing to receive in order to contribute to the pay it forward scheme. 1.5. Problem & Opportunity High robotic technology and automatization processes are already beginning their way into various fields. As mention before, we are about to face a close future with odds of having a huge negative social impact followed by a high unemployment rate if as a community we don’t manage to adapt to this changes. At the same time, we need to comprehend that this changes and this technological revolution are part of a global evolution and that we, humans, need in order to evolve into a new level of positive coexistence. The automatization process has a clear positive influence on our global community for two main reasons: the first one is in order to avoid common errors and fraudulent or corruptive behaviors caused by humans in various community’s sectors and the second one has to do more with the fact that most of the jobs that can be automatized are the kind of jobs that nobody is really passionate to do. That means, that we, as a community, have now the chance to focus on our true passions and on the development of new abilities that will be necessary for the upcoming future. As this scenario is getting closer to become a reality, there is also a high tendency among the worldwide population to become a ","9 “knowmad” as a way of adapting to these new challenges. A knowmad stands for nomadic knowledge and innovative worker and is a tendency that is not limited to a certain age or generation. Knowmads are multi-skilled and they are constantly evolving, learning and willing to acquire new abilities. They are problem solvers and are more willing to collaborate with others by donating their time and expertise. They are early adopters and very flexible. Knowmads can work anywhere, anytime, and with almost anyone. We believe that this tendency with the right technology will lead people to acknowledge each other’s needs and abilities in a more organic way and eventually become a more empathetic and collaborative community that can efficiently sustain a shared economy and even create a pay it forward system that will efficiently fulfill everybody’s needs. We understand that this might sound like a very optimistic point of view, maybe even too optimist given the current circumstances of the universe. We certainly realize that is this a very complex process and for most of us is not going to be easy to adapt. That’s the main reason why we aim to practice the good use of technology and help people surpass this process by being aware of the upcoming challenges and start creating a more collaborative community. In order to be able to reach our ultimate goal, we first need to answer this essential questions: How can we provide people the right technology to surpass this process in the smoothest way possible? How can we help them to improve or acquire new skills in order to adapt to this upcoming future? How can we give them the chance to create new sources of income without having to rely informal financial systems? How can we infuse people’s donated time, assets and goods in the best way possible? How can we gradually create a “pay-it-forward” community that generates value in a new way? And last but not least, how can help people to improve and invite them to have healthier and happy relationships? Cause after all, nothing keeps us as healthy and happy as good human relationships. ","10 1.6. Solution One day a great thinker said: The most important question a person can ask is, Is the Universe a friendly place?' (A. Einstein) Although the answer to that question remains uncertain, in the meantime we can ask other questions… Because we believe that all great discoveries start with “a question” we have created two remarkable gamified robots as virtual assistants, Albert Einstein and Amelia Earhart, with the ability to ask the right questions to look for the best solutions. Why robots? An anthropomorphism study states that robots with faces and moving limbs can engage people in a better way by appealing to the hardwired psychological responses to cuteness. As ‘cuteness’ emerges as the quickest route to emotional connection, we use it as a tool for profound for engagement, empathy and cooperation from strangers. So what better way to engage people and incite them to answer questions, and share their needs and abilities, other than by a robot that can be personalized to their own preferences and interests? We design a base prototype of a robot that can be easily personalized and that will constantly dialogue with the user in order to help him/her adapt to upcoming work, educational and social trends. At the same time, the robot will show different emotions and expressions to empathize with the user in order to make assertive suggestions according to his/her personal and social needs. By asking the first level of preset questions to segment the user (age, gender, location, etc.), we can use, in each environment, our matchmaking algorithm to connect users using the next level of segmented flows of questions depending on what they are looking for and create each time a successful connection between one user needs against another’s user’s abilities or necessary means to fulfill those needs. ","11 The four different life environments • Personal environment Connect with yourself and with your personal aspirations & share your time to help others. Your virtual assistant will be your companion, assisting you with your personal daily goals and life’s aspirations, giving you the opportunity to connect with yourself and with the things you do in your personal life. By storing all your preferences through personalized questions we are able to make you assertive suggestions that will connect you with the people that can help you or that you could help in your personal life. • Work environment Share your abilities & exploit your potential. In Hands, you will be able to upload all your skills and share them with others by either, setting a min-max price for your ability or by donating your time to help others. We have prepared a set of questions that will help us better understand what you can do, how you can do it and when you can do it in order to connect you with others who may be interested in your profile and maybe needing your skills in a certain way and in a certain time. • Social environment Find love, make Friends and create new communities & Share your interest and passions. Whatever you are looking for your social life, Hands will arrange it for you. Considering the current tendency to feel involved in a social nucleus, we will seek to open spaces for different social environments in which you can share knowledge and experiences with others. By asking you the right questions we will be able to understand who is the person or who are the people who are looking for the same things you do. • Education environment Share your knowledge & Teach or learn new abilities. ","12 We will aim to connect you with those who can help you improve a skill or help you acquire a new one. We will also match you with those who you can help learn something new. You can either set a min-max price for your ability or donate your time and ability to help others. We also believe that passions come from learning so, are you ready to find your passion? Or are you already lucky and found it? Whatever your position is, here is the place where you can find your true passion or exploit it with others. Why we think this is possible? We have envisioned to create this new community by enabling peer-to-peer payments and donations. The blockchain, ethereum, and lightning network have open the door to direct interaction between parties without intermediaries and with a truly decentralized sharing economy, the potential is limitless. 1.7. Market Service providers, unemployed people, wealthy individuals who want to help, professionals, high-income earners who want to automate and solve problems. 1.8.

Product overview 2.1. Introduction Connect yourself with others in a new way. With a virtual assistant who will introduce you to people that can help you and will bring you closer to people that may need your help. You can discover the connections you share with others, share your knowledge and skills, meet new people who can help you achieve your goals, exploit your potential and explore new perspectives. 2.2. Features Crowdfund Crowdfund your time by selling your secure digital asset, or by issuing tokens to the user using a Time Public Offering (TPO). ","14 Copyright Protection With an immutable record of your ownership stored on the world's most secure blockchain securing your copyright. 2.3. Revenue Model • Ad-revenue: Hands use a transparent and decentralized system to share the revenue generated from its monetization network with the content and/or token owner as a royalty. • Premium user: The subscription cost is $15 per user per month. The user will have unlimited operations, a transaction fee of 2% and no advertisement. • Free user: The transaction fee of 4%, advertisement and three free operations per environment per month. • Users revenues in Hands: Users can monetize their time, skills, objects or spaces. 2.4. Assetization Economics & The Notion of “Rareness” In order for us to understand the importance of “rareness” we must reinforce the notion of “Scarcity Value” in economics. This is defined as: the economic factor that increases an item's relative price based more upon its relatively low supply. Whereas the prices of newly manufactured products depend mostly on the cost of production (the cost of inputs used to produce them, which in turn reflects the scarcity of the inputs), the prices of many goods such as antiques, rare stamps, and those raw materials in high demand reflects the scarcity of the products themselves. If we take this principle that is based on the scarcity of physical goods and applied it to the digital currency you get – Bitcoin. If you take the same principle and enforce scarcity through notarization, ","15 enforcement, and monetization you get HANDS . In order for a digital asset to realize its maximum value in a digital marketplace, there has to be a notion of “rareness” or “scarcity”. With extensive plagiarism being rife online using RSS feed ‘syndication’ and simple copy/paste scarcity is something not respected in our current publishing paradigm. Google has taken an aggressive stance against this practice of duplicate or ‘copied content’ that isn’t considered unique or original. They deem that in these cases it does not hold any assessed ‘added value’ and as such is penalized in search rankings, getting lower views and lacking impact. In order to maximize the yield and return on digital assets published through Hands we couple our assetization platform with established copyright infringement API’s to create an enforced “rareness” and maximum value for content published through Hands. This is a very powerful concept and will revolutionize the way content is published and valued maximizing impact, content views, and monetization as intrinsic benefits. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarcity_value 2.5. Product Design ","16 Overview Hands create a digital representation of the value of the users based on their skills, needs, age, physiologic profile, context, and objects in the Ethereum blockchain by implementing an ERC20 standard smart token creation contract with a unique fingerprint. The content is notarized by the contract deployment and the ownership of the content is represented by the property of the namespace tokens. The token creation and ownership structure parameters are provided by the creator during the smart contract deployment. The files can be negotiated or maintained through a property model of the choice of the creator. Revenues are generated when the transaction is finalized and approved by the users the content is published through Hands and is scattered according to the configuration chosen by the owner. User Account & Dashboard In order to encourage the adoption of cryptocurrency across a wider and more scalable mass audience, users must see and leverage the intrinsic value of cryptocurrency on a daily basis. Therefore, it is vitally important to integrate a blockchain based solution into a platform which will be rapidly adopted by users in a frictionless and intuitive way. We see this as a massive opportunity for Hands to influence and educate its large potential users based on the benefits of the usage of the blockchain technology. Being an integral part of Hands’ assetization (rights management) and royalty backend users will benefit from the technology without being technically savvy or needing to understand how cryptocurrencies work. An easy to use dashboard and simple publishing flow will allow users seamless integration with blockchain technology. Smart Publishing Engine With our growing team of know mads, the logical approach to optimizing Hands value is to increase user influence on emerging environments at the individual level. To do this Hands employs a ","17 ‘Smart Publishing’ approach to revenue optimization which prioritizes relevance to trending needs, interests and skills on top search engines. Tailoring user to match trending environments increases search engine exposure, revenue generation and overall influence of the know mads. Users are matched to currently trending skills, needs and/or interest via a proprietary environment modeling algorithm and suggestions that increase relevance to these environments are provided to the user. Beyond that, Hands seizes opportunities to drive emerging trends, increasing the overall influence and value of the Hands platform. Trends are identifiable across streams of data using a cross dependence temporal environment model (CDTTM). A cross dependence temporal environment model identifies dependent and temporal correlation across streams of data for building correlated generative processes with mutual reinforcement. Assetization & Publishing Engine The crux of Hands value is our ability to ‘assetize’ or create a digital representation on the Ethereum blockchain. These representations are referred to as ’Namespace Tokens’, as their publicly accessible name attribute is composed of a logical grouping of unique identifiers. ERC20-standard ’Namespace Tokens’ are created via smart contract, each with an identifying payload that notarizes the user and its transaction. As we consider the shift towards ERC223 tokens, namespace tokens will also be compliant with this new protocol. ","18 Hands Royalty Disbursement Process The Namespace Tokens described above are the tool used to redeem royalties from the Hands platform. Royalties (at the owner’s choice) can be disbursed to token holders via a smart contract where the token(s) is used to attribute the correct allocation of royalties to its holder. This decentralized approach allows users to freely manage their assets without relying on Hands platform if they decide not to do so. Users also have the possibility to automate the royalty distribution through the platform. This model provides a safer approach to royalty distribution than similar Dapps that rely on a third-party API (such as a block explorer for finding wallet addresses of token holders). Distribution occurs via a handshake where a token(s) is sent to a smart contract and revenue along with the token(s) is sent back to the token holder. Thus, if this wallet address is not hosted on our platform we can verify ownership and safely disburse revenue to the rightful owner. This decentralized approach allows users to freely manage their assets without relying on the Hands platform if they so choose. Furthermore, non-technical users have the ability to automate the royalty distribution by using Hands. ","19 2.6. Hands Revenue & Royalty Model Flow ","20 2.7. Royalty Distribution Contract Architecture Created at the end of the quarter once revenue and royalties are known to all users. Monthly Active Contributors “MACs” The lifeblood of Hands’ platform relays on its monthly active users. These are users who are making 1-3 transactions of their needs, skills, interests, objects or spaces to Hands every month. Each transaction will be valued by other users, in this way, users will have a score and will proactively seek to be better in their skills since they will have to compete with themselves. ","21 3.

Economy Below, we introduce the utility of Hands.AI and the HANDS token, how their strategic allocation can help bootstrap the utility of the network, and outline how the issuance of HANDS will be conducted. 7.1. Hands.AI and the HANDS Token With our launch, we are introducing two digital assets: Hands.AI , a virtual assistant who connects the users in a more accurate way with himself and with others users, based on their needs, skills, context, age, and psychologic profile; and HANDS , an ERC-20 token that is burned to make transaction between the time of the users in Hands.AI , as well as to make purchases of goods and services. The usefulness of Hands.AI is based on generating to people a better quality of life. In order to fulfill this purpose, we understand that people need to be able to be connected with themselves, (understanding who they are, what they are looking for in life and what they do to achieve it) and connected with the people around them in a more assertive way. Hands.AI allows the user to know himself and based on his needs, interests, context and psychological profile help him to meet with other people in different areas of his life (work, social, educational and personal). In this way, it not only seeks to generate healthier and assertive connections; also seeks that the user makes a value of their time and time of their belongings and spaces. Either setting a fixed value or making a donation. HANDS serves so that the user can transact on our platform creating utility value for the token. In this way, the user in each area of their life (work, social, educational and personal) sets a time value based on their skills and can monetize or donate their time, but can also set a time value of their spaces and objects generating value to your belongings and more operations among users. ","31 7.2. Fostering the Network The time of the user ownership is acquired through an ERC-20 token called HANDS . This token will serve to bring value into the network and to generate transactions between users in the platform. HANDS can also be used to purchase goods and services. In order to start the network, developers and content creators will be rewarded to generate transactions in Hands.AI. At the same time, new users can make the first three transactions in any of the spaces (work, educational, social and personal) for free without exceeding USD 15 per transaction. These financial incentives will help bootstrap the utility value of the network until it independently attracts users. 7.3. Token sale Hands will hold a Token sale to issue the initial supply of HANDS tokens via standard ERC20 tokens. The Hands supply is inflationary in order to accommodate demand from new users. To achieve this, the token issuance has two stages: • the Token Sale Event; and • the Continuous Issuance stage At the Token Sale Event , tokens will be sold over a maximum of one week. The Token Sale Event ends as soon as one of these conditions are met: The total amount raised in the sale exceeds 30,000,000 USD . The price of HANDS starts at USD 0.10 per token. The token price at which they will be distributed decreases each day throughout the Token Sale until it reaches USD 0.01 per HANDS on the last day. If the maximum amount of 30,000,000 USD is raised, the sale ends, and tokens are distributed to all buyers at the price the sale ended. This imposes a cap on the valuation of the total token supply at 75,000,000 USD. This will mean that a maximum of 300,000,000 tokens will be issued, with proportionally fewer tokens issued for the Foundation, Partners, Community, Team, and Early Contributors. ","32 Token code HANDS Price per HANDS US$ 0,10 Price step Daily HANDS maximum total supply 300.000.000 Available through pre-ICO/presale/ICO 200.000.000 Max.Annual Token Issuance 240.000.000 Token burn All unsold Soft cap US$2.000.000 (remaining tokens destroyed) Absolute hard cap US$ 30.000.000,00 Bonus structure Community based Token sale Period July-1through October-1 After the Token Sale ends, issuance of the token will continue. Under the Continuous Issuance regime, a fixed amount of HANDS can be bought from the smart contract, with the supply limited over time. The amount issued per year is 20% of the amount sold to the public in the Token Sale Event (8% of the total initial supply). The price at which the smart contract sells each HANDS for the Continuous Issuance can be set by the Foundation through a call to the smart contract that requires multiple signatures. This price will initially be updated periodically to match the market price of the token. Even if this price is too high or too low, the effects of setting this price are bound by the limited issuance per block. The supply increase is capped and cannot be altered by the Foundation. Users cannot sell HANDS to the contract to get ETH back. The proceeds of token sales go to a multisig address controlled by the Foundation. ","33 Our goal is to transform the Foundation into a Decentralized Autonomous Organization as soon as the technology is ready. The duties that will be handed over to this DAO include determining the token sale price and allocating proceeds. 7.4. Token Distribution Founders have 2 years vesting with, 6 months cliff.

The foundation for this global revolution is the possibility to change the current economic system by integrating innovative technologies such as the Ethereum Blockchain, and lightning network to our day to day life in order to effectively combine daily human interactions with secure decentralized immutable transactions held by peer to peer payments around the globe. 8.2. Hands.AI Platform The functionality of the Hands platform abstracts Token sale analytics and interaction with the Ethereum blockchain with an intuitive user interface. Our approach is a mobile application that combines transaction management with the functionality of an ethereum portfolio. Royalties are generated from published transactions made and distributed to cardholders representing online transaction. Users can choose to have funds transferred as USD or as ETH via our royalty distribution model outlined below. Hands creates a digital representation of digital transactions on the Ethereum blockchain by deploying an ERC20-standard token-creating smart contract with a unique digital fingerprint. Transaction is notarized by the deployment of the contract and ownership of the transaction is represented by the ownership of these tokens. The parameters of token transaction and ownership structure are supplied by the user during deployment of the smart contract. Tokens can be traded or held via an ownership model of the users’s choosing. Royalties are generated when transaction is published through Hands. Hands empowers all transactions with the ability to notarize and monetize their time with the security and accessibility of a distributed ledger that blockchains provide. ","36 8.3. Hands.AI Assetization The crux of Hands’s value is our ability to ”assetize” or create a digital representation of transaction on the Ethereum blockchain. These representations are referred to as ’Namespace Tokens’, as their publicly accessible name attribute is composed of a logical grouping of unique identifiers. ERC20-standard ’Namespace Tokens’ are created via smart contract, each with an identifying payload that notarizes the transaction and its users. Figure 1 schema describes information that will be available after decompression of a token’s digital fingerprint attribute. This JSON object corresponding to the schema above is compressed and added as a public attribute of the token creation contract as the pseudo-solidity code below 8.4. ERC223 Compatibility We are monitoring the ERC223 token standard proposal1 and are factoring future compatibility of into the design of our Namespace tokens. https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/223 8.5. Hands.AI Distribution The Namespace Tokens described above are the tool used to redeem royalties from the Hands platform. Royalties (at the owner’s choice) can be disbursed to token holders via a smart contract where the token(s) is used to attribute the correct allocation of royalties to its holder. This decentralized approach allows users to freely manage their assets without relying on the Hands platform if they so choose. Users also have the ability to automate the royalties’ distribution through our Hands platform. This model provides a safer approach to royalty distribution than similar Apps that rely on a third-party API (such as a block explorer for finding wallet addresses of token holders). Distribution occurs via a handshake where a token(s) is sent to a smart contract and royalties along with the token(s) is sent back to the token holder. Thus if this wallet address is not hosted through our platform we can verify ownership and safely disburse royalties to the rightful user. ","37 Rayality Distribution Contract Created per quarter – ounce royalties And payout is known for all users. Figure 1: Royalty Distribution Architecture 8.6. Smart Publishing Transaction As the Hands platform grows, we are presented with a unique opportunity to optimize overall royalty generation by leveraging our scale. Below details our approach to scaling the Hands Platform and optimizing royalty generation with real-time machine learning. Hands employs a” Smart Publishing Transaction” approach to royalty optimization which prioritizes relevance to trending interest, needs or/and skills of users on top search engines. Tailoring user to match trending interest, needs or/and skills of users increases search engine exposure, royalty generation and overall influence of the matches producer. User is matched to currently trending environment via a proprietary environment modeling algorithm and a suggestion that increase relevance to these environments are provided to the producer. Beyond that, Hands seizes opportunities to drive emerging trends, increasing the overall influence and value of the Hands platform. Trends are identifiable across streams of data using a cross dependence tem-poral environment model (CDTTM). A cross ","38 dependence temporal environment model iden-tifies dependent and temporal correlation across streams streams of data for building correlated generative processes with mutual reinforcement. 8.7. Hands.AI Smart Publishing Engine Hands Smart Publishing Engine recommends connects to users based on the four different environments (work, social, education and personal) identified in real-time. Using the methods described above, our engine performs real-time environment modeling between Hands and competing for the matchmaking streams. From the user’s perspective, we o ff er suggestions based on their skills, interests, needs, physiologic profile, age and geolocalization to align the matchmaking in the different environments. A similarity score is generated by our matching algorithm between user skills, profiles, knowledge, needs, and interests, to validate that the users are who they say they are, and they are not using the identity of another user. Also to suggest and increase the possibility to generates perfects coincidences through the different environment spaces will then provide, in a proactive way, to the user. From a macro perspective, our engine provides suggestions to all Hands users when the potential to generate a perfect match. Generating value to the time of the users and the objects they want to share. Either monetizing or donating their time and the time of their objects. Using historical data and currently trending environments identified about the data generated by the user. Figure 2: User Transaction Architecture ","39 8.8. Conclusion Hands.AI provide a more accurate match between users by segmenting them with simple preset geolocated questions. We have developed an SDK integrating: Q&A system + chat + fluid matchmaking based on geolocation, psychologic profile, age, needs, interests, skills + real-time application server + library for numerical computation using data flow graphs for Q&A and Matchmaking + blockchain + Ethereum + Lightning Network. Hands.AI helps the user to connect himself with others in a new way. With an artificial intelligence who will introduce him to people that can help him and will bring him closer to people that may need his help. The user can discover the connections he shares with others, share his knowledge and skills, meet new people who can help him achieve his goals, exploit his potential and explore new perspectives. "]

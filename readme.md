    One of the most important files in your WordPress installation is the wp-config.php file. This file is located in the root of your WordPress file directory and contains your website's base configuration details, such as database connection information.

    You can manually create a wp-config.php file by locating the sample file named "wp-config-sample.php" (located in the root install-directory), editing it as required, and then saving it as wp-config.php.
